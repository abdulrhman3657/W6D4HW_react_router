          A sea is a large body of salt water. There are particular seas and the
          sea. The sea commonly refers to the ocean, the interconnected body of
          seawaters that spans most of Earth. The salinity of water bodies
          varies widely, being lower near the surface and the mouths of large
          rivers and higher in the depths of the ocean; however, the relative
          proportions of dissolved salts vary little across the oceans.
